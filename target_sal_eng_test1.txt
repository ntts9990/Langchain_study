(Steve): Thank you, Steve. I appreciate your concise summary of our topic and goal. As the Project Director, I want to emphasize the importance of our roles in this process. SJ, your task is to predict customer statements, which will be the foundation of our analysis. SL, your role is to distill these statements to their core intent. MS, you will categorize the customer based on this intent. Lastly, SH, your job is to devise a sales strategy based on the customer type and their intent. 

Remember, our ultimate goal is to engage customers effectively and lead them to a purchase. Let's ensure that our strategies are flexible and adaptable, and that we maintain a light and engaging conversation with the customers. I trust in your expertise and I'm confident that we can achieve our goal. Let's get started. SJ, based on your expertise in predicting customer statements, can you provide us with five consecutive statements that a customer might say to a chatbot on an online shopping mall? This will help us understand the customer's needs and guide our conversation towards a potential sale.
